# Memory Card Game 
## Rock Star Version
This Memory Card game follows the classic version's structure and goals. However, this updated version includes a deck of 20 cards containing 10 pairs, featuring 10 famous and popular rock stars. The game is simple and intuitive, requiring players to click on each card to flip it over and find its matching pair.

Before starting the game, players will be prompted to log in and enter their name. The name should contain at least 3 and no more than 12 characters. Once the name is entered, players can click the start button and begin playing.

Upon starting the game, players will be presented with a deck of cards. Clicking each card one by one will reveal its face, and players must find all 10 pairs to complete the game. The objective of the game is to complete it with as few attempts as possible.

We hope you enjoy playing the Rok Star memory game!
