This Memory Card game follows the same structure and goals as the classic version. In this updated version, you will have a deck of 20 cards containing 10 pairs. It is a simple and intuitive game, requiring you to flip over each card by clicking on it in order to find a matching pair. This is the first version of the Rok Stark memory game, featuring 10 famous and popular rock stars.

Before starting the game, you will be prompted to login and enter your name. Your name should contain at least 3 characters and no more than 12. Once you've filled in the appropriate space with your name, you will be able to click the start button and begin playing the game.

On the next page, you will see the deck of cards. Click each card one by one until you have found all 10 pairs. The main objective of the game is to complete the game with the fewest attempts possible.

So, enjoy playing the Rok Stark memory game!
